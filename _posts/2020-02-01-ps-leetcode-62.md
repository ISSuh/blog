### [ 62. Unique Paths ](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/) - medium

#### 문제

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

![example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png)

Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

#### 제한사항
- m and n will be at most 100.

#### 입출력 예

```
Example 1:
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right

Example 2:
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```

#### 풀이
  - DP

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        if(m == 1 || n == 1)
            return 1;
        
        vector<vector<int>> item(m, vector<int>(n, 1));
        
        for(auto i = 1 ; i < m ; ++i){
            for(auto j = 1 ; j < n ; ++j){
                item[i][j] = item[i-1][j] + item[i][j-1]; 
            }
        }
        
        return item[m-1][n-1];
    }
};
