### [ 1143. Longest Common Subsequence ](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/) - medium

#### 문제

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

#### 제한사항

- 1 <= text1.length <= 1000
- 1 <= text2.length <= 1000
- The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.

#### 입출력 예

```
Example 1:

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

```
Example 2:

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

```
Example 3:

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

![example](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/votrubac/image_1564691262.png)

```go
func longestCommonSubsequence(text1 string, text2 string) int {
    grid := make([][]int, len(text1)+1)
    for i := 0 ; i <= len(text1) ; i++ {
        grid[i] = make([]int, len(text2)+1)
    }
    
    for m := 1 ; m <= len(text1) ; m++ {
        for n := 1 ; n <= len(text2) ; n++ {
            if text1[m-1] == text2[n-1] {
                grid[m][n] = grid[m-1][n-1] + 1
            } else {                
                if grid[m-1][n] >= grid[m][n-1] {
                    grid[m][n] = grid[m-1][n]
                } else {
                    grid[m][n] = grid[m][n-1]                    
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return grid[len(text1)][len(text2)]
}
