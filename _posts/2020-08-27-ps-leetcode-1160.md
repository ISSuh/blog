#### 문제

You are given an array of strings words and a string chars.

A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.

#### 제한사항

- 1 <= words.length <= 1000
- 1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100
- All strings contain lowercase English letters only.


#### 입출력 예

```
Example 1:

Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
```

```
Example 2:

Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
Output: 10
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countCharacters(vector<string>& words, string chars) {
        int result = 0;
        std::map<char, int> m;
        
        for (auto& c : chars) {
            ++m[c];
        }
        `
        for (const auto& str : words) {
            int matchCount = 0;
            auto tempMap = m;
            
            for (auto& c : str) {
                if (tempMap[c] > 0) {
                    --tempMap[c];
                    ++matchCount;
                }
            }
            
            if (matchCount == str.size()) {
                result += str.size();
            }
        }
