Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
```

```
Example 2:

Input: s = "RLLLLRRRLR"
Output: 3
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR", "LR", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.

```go
func balancedStringSplit(s string) int {
    var m = make(map[rune]int)
    var count = 0
    
    for _, v := range s {
        m[v]++
        
        if m['L'] == m['R'] {
            count++
        }
