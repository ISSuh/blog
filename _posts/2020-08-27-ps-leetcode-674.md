### [ 674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence ](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/) - easy

#### 문제

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).



#### 제한사항

- Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.

#### 입출력 예

```
Example 1:

Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4.
```

```
Example 2:

Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1.
```

#### 풀이
- Array

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findLengthOfLCIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int maxLength = 0;
        
        int count = 1;
        for (auto i = 0 ; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[i+1]) {
                ++count;
            } else {
                maxLength = std::max(count, maxLength);
                count = 1;
            }
        }
        
        maxLength = std::max(count, maxLength);

        return maxLength;
    }
};
```
